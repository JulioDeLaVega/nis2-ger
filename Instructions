Alternative 1: GDPR art. 9 (Processing of special categories of personal data):  

As consequence of the COVID-19 rule changes regarding quarantine and isolation, fewer tests are being administered by health officials. Nonetheless there is still a need for the authorities to track the spread of the virus in the general population. As such the Norwegian health ministry is looking to use data from both previous and future tests to create a model for the development of the rate of transition of the virus in the general population. There are however some concerns with the development in regards to the appropriation of the data collected, both from PCR-tests (swabs from nasal passage) and the antibodies tests (from blood samples (Links to an external site.)). The health ministry has understood that the data collected are deemed special categories of personal data pursuant to article 9 of the GDPR. They have therefore requested the development of an application that will assist them in navigating the legality of processing of personal data in accordance with article 9 (Links to an external site.), both in relation to the data from PCR-tests and the antibodies tests.
